<h2>My File Sender (In-Development)</h2>

<p>My File Sender is a SFTP client that is based on SSH.Net lib that has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local and remote FileSystem Navigation</li>
<li>Transfer files from/to the two computers as easy as just dragging and dropping the file</li>
<li>The ability to save the connection to the server for later use</li>
<li>Search your saved connections</li>
<li>Built-in DNS client that allows you to resolve domains in case connecting to a remote server with a domain name</li>
</ul>

<h3>Techincal Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The app is using a third-party package (SSH.Net), so any security issues in the library might effect the security of the app.</li>
<li>Sometimes the app will not be able to distinguish files from folders so you might see conflicted icons but when you click on that file it will navigate to it</li>
<li>There must be a SFTP server on the other side in order to be able to transfer files</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Featues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Transfering data between a PC and an Android Phone</li>
<li>Maybe a SFTP Server to make it a full suite</li>
</ul>
